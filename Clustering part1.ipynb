    "Q2.What is K-means clustering, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "K-means clustering is a widely used unsupervised machine learning algorithm that partitions a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping clusters. Each cluster is represented by its center, which is typically the mean (average) of the data points within that cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works as follows:\n",
    "1.Initialization:\n",
    "   Randomly select K data points as the initial cluster centroids.\n",
    "   These initial centroids can be chosen randomly from the dataset or by other methods, such as k-means++ initialization, which aims to select centroids that are far apart from each other.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Assignment Step (Expectation Step):\n",
    "   For each data point in the dataset, calculate its distance to each of the K centroids.\n",
    "   Assign the data point to the cluster whose centroid is closest, i.e., the cluster that minimizes the distance.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Update Step (Maximization Step):\n",
    "   Recalculate the centroids of each cluster based on the data points assigned to that cluster. The new centroid is the mean of all the data points in the cluster.\n",
    "   This step moves the cluster centers to the center of the data points assigned to that cluster.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Convergence Check:\n",
    "   Repeat the assignment and update steps iteratively until one of the convergence criteria is met. Common criteria include:\n",

    "Sensitive to Initialization: \n",
    "    The choice of initial centroids can significantly impact the final clustering results, potentially leading to suboptimal solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption of Spherical Clusters: \n",
